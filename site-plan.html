      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to provide convenience to site visitors with our web design. We also want our visitors to benefit from our services.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target audience is those who are looking for the best build guide for their character about genshin impact. Especially on weapons and artifacts that will increase their character's attack status. Our site visitors are genshin impact players who are looking for a build that suits them. Most visitors will be visiting via a phone and desktop computer.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Main Topic</h2>
      <li>Reason people should come to my site.</li>
      <p>I’m making a website about Genshin Impact. In 2020, Genshin Impact took the video game industry by storm, attracting a large player-base and generating nearly $400 million in revenue within its first two months on the market. For context, this was more than Pokémon GO, which generated $238 million in revenue within the same time period. At first glance, Genshin Impact might look like just another anime open-world game, but there are a lot of interesting things going on that set it apart.  Genshin Impact is one of the biggest game in South East Asia. Genshin Impact has gained global popularity since its global release last September. The game offers heaps of playable content, with the open world of Teyvat holding lore and treasure waiting to be uncovered. As players take the Traveler through their journey to find their lost sibling, they often find little novelties that the game has to offer. I think people will come to my website because peoples (in this case, Genshin Impact players) tend to know deeper about the game. Either it is about their character, their character’s ability, artifact, or how to easily beat enemies with lots of damage. Nowadays, Genshin Impact’s forums are fully loaded with lots of question about how to be better in the game. So, that’s why I made a website about Genshin Impact. On my website, there will be facts about Genshin Impact, knowledge, details of the character, etc. </p>
      <br>
      <li>Activities that can be done on my site.</li>
      <p>Types of activities that visitors want to complete on my sites are seeing builds of characters. Like what weapon should this character use, what artifact should that character use, how to beat enemies like Spiral Abyss for example, etc. So that visitors can copy and replicate build that I provide to their accounts. Because each characters in Genshin Impact have different characteristic and different gameplay, so every build for every characters are also different. This is important to note, because, if visitors (players) want to make their character have lots of damage, they need to make a right build. For example, there is one character named Childe. Childe is a water element based character (in game, water based character is called Hydro). So, if you want get lots of damage by using Childe, you need to use weapon like Thundering Pulse, Ploar star, Skyward Harp, Amos Bow. Not only by weapon, you can maximize Childe’s ability by using artifact set. Recommended artifact set for Childe are 4 piece Heart of depth or 4 piece Shimenawa's reminiscence. Most of Childe user are prioritizing their attack percentage, hydro damage bonus and critical rate or damage. Not only those, players can maximize Childe’s ability by pairing them with some of other characters, like Xiangling, Bennett, Fischl, Beidou, Xingqiu, Kazuha, Venti, Sucrose, Rosaria, Diona, Zhongli.</p>
      <br>
      <li>Differentiate between others website.</li>
      <p>Visitors will come to my site instead of another site to get these kind of information or complete the actions because on other websites, it tend to contain lots of unrelateable content about the topic that should be explained. Like for example, on big websites, they tend to put lots of ads so that the information will remain less visible rather than the ads itself. Also, other websites are tend to give false information. Like for this topic, there are lots of websites that giving false build or false pairing characters for the character on Genshin Impact. Or, the information given on other websites are completely irrelevant than it should. On my website instead, I give lots of information about what weapon should this character use, what artifact should that character use, how to beat enemies like Spiral Abyss for example, etc. Also, for now, there won’t be any disturbing content like ads for example. So, visitors can come and read the article easily without getting disrupted or disturbed by any unrelateable content.Not only builds for Genshin Impact’s characters, there will be also some history about the game, in the future I would like to also add another content to my website like fun facts about the game Itself and each of the characters, etc.</p>

        Welcome to Genshin Guide! Learn everything there is to know about Genshin Impact, including our Tier List and builds for all characters, story and quest walkthroughs, and more!
        
      <br>
      Genshin Impact is a free to play game from developer MiHoYo, and combines a mix of Zelda: Breath of the Wild-style exploration and design with popular "gacha" microtransactions to collect new characters and weapons.
      <br>
        <br>
      While its style is similar to other games in some regards, there is a lot of information given to players early on that can be difficult to parse through. This page serves as an explainer for several of the mechanics and features in Genshin Impact.
        <br>
      <br>
      In Genshin Impact, Each character will have a basic attack, a stronger charge up attack, an Elemental Skill, and an Elemental Burst. They can also wield a sword, 2-handed claymore, bow, or a magic catalyst. With over 20 Characters already in the game, you'll find many different combinations of weapons and elements, allowing you to mix and match a team to cater to your style - if you can obtain the right characters that is.
